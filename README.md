# Playing around with the Github API

I've been learning more about APIs. This is a quick project that offers an input field to search for a user. 

If the string matches a Github username, it displays some information in the DOM.

Working version of this can be found on Codepen here: [https://codepen.io/mushroom23/full/WYxpzv/]
